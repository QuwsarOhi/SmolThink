Since C++ does not have a built-in random number generator, I can use the `rand()` function to generate a random number. However, `rand()` is not recommended for generating random numbers for security or statistical purposes, so I will use the `random` library which is more secure.\\n\\nNext, I need to decide how to use the generated random number to determine the outcome of the coin toss. I can use a simple if statement to check if the number is even or odd, and return 'heads' or 'tails' accordingly.\\n\\nHowever, I also need to consider the potential mistakes I could make. One mistake could be to forget to include the necessary headers for the `random` library.
